Redesign of the official website of The Mother's International School. 

During the spring of 2015, I was tasked with a complete design overhaul of the school's official website. Being an information heavy website, the main challenge was to present and convey a large volume of information clearly and effectively, without compromising on content clarity and design simplicity.  

The site was developed on top of a custom made Wordpress theme, and made use of HTML5, CSS3, Ajax and the Zurb Foundation front end framework.
